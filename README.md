<h1 align="center">Custom ViT :computer:</h1>

Custom ViT is a personal project developed as part of my Master's Thesis at Sapienza University of Rome. It focuses on enhancing Vision Transformers by integrating ensemble learning with virtual subnetworks to improve accuracy and robustness in computer vision tasks.

In the following repository it's possible to open:  

* Short presentation of the proposed solution
* Colab Notebook with full code implementation (which can also be opened directly in Colab [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1J1AHSbuTBBZyGG7Bkl5K3LQp1jVXUvga?usp=sharing))
* All the [checkpoints](https://github.com/aferrante99/Custom-ViT/tree/main/Checkpoints) to avoid training the models again ðŸ˜ƒ
* The full master thesis

For any info/problem please write to the following [e-mail](aferrante99@gmail.com).
